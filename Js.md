# Javascript

Usage of Comments in JavaScript coding: Comments are extremely useful in programming because they can assist others to understand what's going on in your code or they can help you if you have forgotten something. Keep in mind that they must be correctly identified so that the browser does not attempt to execute them. There are two alternatives available in JavaScript in which we can add comments:
Single-line comments: If you want to include a single line comment, start it with "//".
Multi-line comments: If you want to write a comment that spans multiple lines, you can wrap it in /_ and _/ to prevent it from being executed.
